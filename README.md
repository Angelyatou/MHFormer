## Dependencies

- Cuda 11.1
- Python 3.6
- Pytorch 1.7.1

## Dataset setup

Please download the dataset from [Human3.6m](http://vision.imar.ro/human3.6m/) website and refer to [VideoPose3D](https://github.com/facebookresearch/VideoPose3D) to set up the Human3.6M dataset ('./dataset' directory). 

```bash
${POSE_ROOT}/
|-- dataset
|   |-- data_3d_h36m.npz
|   |-- data_2d_h36m_cpn_ft_h36m_dbb.npz
```

## Download pretrained model

The pretrained model can be found in [Google_Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19yIV-XzdtAYZQ2gQsZQyN844lzlTlToa?usp=sharing), please download it and put in the './checkpoint' dictory. 

## Test the model

To test on pretrained model on Human3.6M:

```bash
python main.py --reload --previous_dir 'checkpoint/pretrained'
```

Here, we compare our MHFormer with recent state-of-the-art methods on Human3.6M dataset. Evaluation metric is Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) in mmâ€‹. 

|   Models    |  MPJPE   |
| :---------: | :------: |
| VideoPose3D |   46.8   |
| PoseFormer  |   44.3   |
|  MHFormer   | **43.0** |

## Train the model

To train on Human3.6M:

```bash
python main.py --train
```
